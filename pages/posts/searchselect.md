## Search Select

I started learning Web Development intensely this January 2022. And I quickly realised that learning involves using Google (or any other search engine) a lot.

Like most developers, I prefer using the keyboard for most tasks. Few actions that I perform frequently using the keyboard are opening/closing tabs, switching tabs, navigating forward/backward and closing windows.

A shortcut to select the links on Google after I search was missing in my workflow. This problem seems trivial on the surface. "How difficult is it to move your hand to the mouse to click on a link?" You're right - it's not. But it's not convenient when you are consistently performing 100+ searches every day.

That's why I created [Search Select](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/search-select/ijpalmkmpikekpglgjacfnaecdidhmgn). A lightweight web extension for Chrome. It allows users to select and view search results quickly using shortcuts. Initially I had no idea how to create a browser extension. I wrote some JavaScript and made it work as intended by using the browser's console. I turned this to an extension after speaking to my friends who liked the idea.

I would love for you to try the [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/search-select/ijpalmkmpikekpglgjacfnaecdidhmgn). [Let me know](mailto:alabhya10@gmail.com) if it has been helpful to you!
